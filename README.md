# sidebar-updater
A super simple script for updating the subreddit's sidebar with current server information.

## Howto
This is a Python 2.7 project. Make sure you're using Python 2 in your shell before proceeding!

It's also horribly broken, mainly because the import of `libopenttd-python2` with a git link causes setuptools to catch fire (things like missing config files, such as `logging.cfg`). Please feel free to fix this and pull request in!
